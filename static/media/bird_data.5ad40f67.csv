The peregrine is renowned for its speed, reaching up to 320 km/h (200 mph) during its characteristic hunting stoop (high-speed dive),[5] making it the fastest member of the animal kingdom.[6][7][8] According to a National Geographic TV program, the highest measured speed of a peregrine falcon is 389 km/h (242 mph).[9][10] As is typical for bird-eating raptors, peregrine falcons are sexually dimorphic, with females being considerably larger than males.[11][12]",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Falco_peregrinus_good_-_Christopher_Watson.jpg/220px-Falco_peregrinus_good_-_Christopher_Watson.jpg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peregrine_falcon
